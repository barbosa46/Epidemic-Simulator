# Epidemic-Simulator
A computer model that simulates a SIR epidemic model with quarantine option in a dynamic network.
To use this model you will need python3 and some libraries (networkX, matplotlib and numpy).
You can install those with the command:
`pip3 install networkx matplotlib numpy`

You can run the model with the following command:
`python3 epidemic.py`

If you want to change come parameters you just have to open the 'epidemic.py' file and there is a box of the variables you can easily play around.
In case you want to do some processing and not just visualing, you can just delete the code inside the 'Animation' ASCII box. 
There is a 'run()' function that does the simulation without the animation part, you may find it useful.
